# Hashtag_Analysis

Script to produce an anlysis of the twitter exchange produced before, during and after a given event (conferences, meetings...). It includes an analyses on when most tweets are produced, who produces them, which are the most active users and the most cited and retweeted users.

*NOTE:* The code to generate the document was originally developed by Francois Michonneau (fmic_ on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/fmic_)) for the 2015 Evolution conference, and can be found [here](https://github.com/fmichonneau/evol2015-tweets). The code was then subsequently [modified](https://github.com/jlehtoma/iccb2015-tweets/blob/gh-pages/index.Rmd) for the ICCB-ECCB 2015 congress by Joona Lehtomaki ([jlehtoma](https://twitter.com/jlehtoma) on Twitter), and by [Emily J. Rollinson](http://rollinsonecology.com/) ([ejrollinson](https://twitter.com/ejrollinson) on Twitter), for the 2015 (Baltimore, #ESA100), and 2016 (Fort Lauderdale, Florida, #ESA2016) Ecological Society of America congresses. I have also incorporated some elements of the network analysis done by [Keith H.Turner](http://twitter.com/kay_aych) for [ISME2016](https://github.com/khturner/HashtagISME16).
